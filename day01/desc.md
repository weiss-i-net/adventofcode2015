## --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect *fifty stars* by December 25th.


Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants *one star*. Good luck!


Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.


Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.


An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.


The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.


For example:


* `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.
* `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.
* `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.
* `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).
* `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.


To *what floor* do the instructions take Santa?
